Brief:
 Customers can take their time for non-supported OS migration, while we deliver security patching for Linux kernel. Without continued security updates, a server is increasingly susceptible to newly discovered vulnerabilities and associated attacks. It is challenging for organizations to migrate to the newest versions of CentOS-like operating systems, but at the same time, they cannot live without ongoing support either. Now you can make this problem disappear. Operating systems like CentOS 8 Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) from CloudLinux allows you to continue your business with OS beyond the end of support… even for 4 more years if you want! All of your fixes, patches, etc will continue to flow just like today, only from CloudLinux repos: simple and easy. 
In Pipeline
Android on RISC-V
There is a potential client who wants to run Android on RISC-V based processor. We are using BeagleBoard Fire for development. BeagleV®-Fire is a revolutionary single-board computer (SBC) powered by Microchip’s PolarFire® MPFS025T 5x core RISC-V System on Chip (SoC) with FPGA fabric. BeagleV®-Fire opens up new horizons for developers, tinkerers, and the open-source community to explore the vast potential of RISC-V architecture and FPGA technology. Details of the board here: 
BeagleBoard Fire
Notable Past Work
Qualcomm:
Worked on Qualcomm's camera ISP chips for device driver development and Android camera HAL customization. 
POC for Google's ChromeOS camera driver requirements for devices with Qualcomm camera hardware.
OnePlus:
Worked on OnePlus' charging drivers' porting and maintenance. 
In charge of India's sensor BSP team. Bringup, development, customization, and maintenance of OnePlus' sensor firmware, Android HAL and framework. The sensors used in OnePlus' Android smartphones were: accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light and proximity sensor, magnetometer, and SAR sensor.
