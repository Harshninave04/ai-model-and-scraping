Description:
Our services are designed to meet the unique needs of our clients, leveraging our expertise in Linux Kernel development and Android BSP development. Here are some of the key services we offer:
Linux Kernel Development
Our Linux kernel development services provide customized kernel and driver design to optimize your device and system according to your specific requirements. This includes:
Developing drivers for various processor architectures such as x86, ARM, RISC-V, PowerPC, SPARC, and others.
Building file systems from scratch and modifying existing ones.
Configuring task scheduling and management systems.
Building networking stacks.
Engineering specific codes for low-level architecture.
Performing device tree configuration.
Setting up memory management systems.
Developing framebuffer, V4L2, and USB interfaces.
We assist customers in adapting operating system kernels to hardware platforms and developing drivers for essential peripherals such as audio, graphics, RTC, NAND, sensors, data exchange, and power.
Board Support Package (BSP) Development
Our embedded Linux Board Support Packages (BSP) development includes:
Creation of BSP with boot loaders (U-Boot, custom).
Development of drivers, protocol stacks, and system interfaces.
Power-on self-test sequence development.
Profiling and code optimization.
Documentation development.
Contribution to mainline open-source projects.
With our Linux BSP development services, you secure a tailored foundation for your embedded operating systems, ensuring optimal performance.
Asymmetric Multiprocessor Processing (AMP)
We utilize asymmetric multiprocessing, where multiple operating systems run on a multi-core chip. One core runs Linux, managing data transfer, protocol support, and user interface access, while the other core executes a real-time operating system (RTOS), handling real-time processes.
Additional Services
Linux System Design: Cloud integration, OTA updates, OS migration, IoT and embedded security implementation, customization of Linux distributions, and GStreamer-based video and audio software solutions development.
Middleware Development and Porting: We develop middleware that connects different apps, systems, and components, using technologies like XML, SOAP, web services, and service-oriented architecture.
Optimization: Our team identifies vulnerabilities, reduces energy consumption, optimizes processor performance, and enhances the operation of RAM, ROM, and flash memory to improve overall system performance.
